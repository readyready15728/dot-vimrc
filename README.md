## .vimrc and any ancillary files

Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all files other than `.vimrc` itself are
to be installed in `$HOME/.vim/`. `.vimrc` itself is of course meant to go
directly into `$HOME`. Note that at least one feature (backup directories) is
currently only configured to work in a Unix(-like) environment. Additionally,
it is necessary to install Vundle as described here:

https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim

Optionally, if you like it, you can install the eldar colorscheme for full
compatibility with my configuration:
