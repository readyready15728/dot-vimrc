# dot-vimrc
.vimrc and any ancillary files

Unless explicitly specified otherwise, all files other than `.vimrc` itself are
to be installed in `$HOME/.vim/`. `.vimrc` itself is of course meant to go
directly into `$HOME`. Note that at least one feature (backup directories) is
currently only configured to work in a Unix(-like) environment.
